# Respiratory Pathogen Information Hub

## Overview
The Respiratory Pathogen Information Hub is a web application designed to provide comprehensive information about various respiratory pathogens.

## Features
- **Pathogen Search:** Users can search for specific respiratory pathogens by their scientific or common names with autocomplete support.
- **General Information:** Users can access inforamtion such as scientific names, common aliases, major subtypes, genome types, and associated symptoms for each pathogen.
- **Gene Annotation:** Detailed gene annotation data is provided for each pathogen.
- **NCBI Reference Sequence Access:** Direct links to NCBI reference sequences are available for further exploration.
- **Support for Multiple Segments:** The application has a specialized layout for pathogens with segmented genomes (influenza).

## Usage
1. Enter a search term and hit submit.
